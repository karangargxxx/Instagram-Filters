# Instagram-Filters
Just the functionality to apply filters and save the image to albums
Improved UI to make a drop down menu of filters
(Drop down menu does not exist in ios, so, made a button and a uiTableView and made the functionality of drop down menu using these two.)
Also removed the bug for which some images were flipped upside down after applying any filter.
